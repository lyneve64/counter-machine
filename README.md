# Counter Machine

## Instruction Set
(Based off of the Minsky instruction set)
- inc(register): Increment register
- dec(register): Decrement register
- jez(register)(line): Jump to line if register == 0
- jnz(register)(line): Jump to line if register != 0
- jmp(line): Jump to line
- hlt: Halts the program

## What will I need to achieve this
### Basic Functionality:
- [X] Reading files
- [X] Interpreting and executing instructions from read files
- [X] Returning output
- [ ] Halt automatically at end of program
### Q.O.L:
- [ ] Stepping through instructions
